# programming_month

In this month we are going to epxlore open source projects to contribute to, we will have two paths to follow: 
- Frontend path: in this path we will contribute to open source project that is well defined and maintained, the mainters will have a direct connection with the developers to make the entry barrier easier for students.
- Free path: In this path, those who are not interested in frontend will be able to explore their desired fields by looking and searching online, the program will offer a safe place to share knowledge and mentorship.

The main output of this program will be: 
- the ability to contribute to open source porject
- at least having one pr opened and merged
